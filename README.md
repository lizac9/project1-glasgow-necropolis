# Glasgow Necropolis

[View the Live Project here](https://lizac9.github.io/project1-glasgow-necropolis/)

This is a website promoting Glasgow Necropolis, situated in Glasgow, Scotland. The purpose of this website is to provide practical information about the location, history and opening hours of the Necropolis. The website also includes the option to book a tour using an interactive form and contains some photographic resources to encourage tourism.

## Features:

### UI/UX:
**Colour Scheme:**
- The main colours used are in a grey scale. The text is pulled the text forward from the background, assisting legibility. These colours also compliment the illustration and photographic resources on the website, maintaining a balance and consistency throughout. 
In the event of creating print media, the previous use of grey scale in the “branding” of the Necropolis will be far more cost effective in printing and designing expenses. 

**Typography:**
- The IM Fell English font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The website header uses Grenze Gotish font with sans-serif as backup. The fonts stylised but tidy and legible appearance were my reasons for choosing it for this website. This font compliments the visual atmosphere of the Necropolis itself, without being too distracting.

### Existing Features:

1. Navigation Bar:

    Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, History and Book a Tour page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    Through the navigation bar, the user can easily move around and take full advantage of all the features provided by the website.
