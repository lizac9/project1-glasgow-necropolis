## Features:
### UI/UX:
#### **Colour Scheme:**
- The main colours used are in a grey scale. The text is pulled forward from the background, assisting legibility. These colours also compliment the illustration and photographic resources on the website, maintaining a balance and consistency throughout. 
In the event of creating print media, the previous use of grey scale in the “branding” of the Necropolis will be far more cost effective in printing and designing expenses. 

#### **Typography:**
- The IM Fell English font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The website header uses Grenze Gotish font with sans-serif as backup. The fonts stylised but tidy and legible appearance were my reasons for choosing it for this website. This font compliments the visual atmosphere of the Necropolis itself, without being too distracting.

#### **Debugging:**
The responsiveness of the website was challenging in general. The book a tour page was particularly difficult, the social media icons would be appear in the middle of the form instead of the bottom footer. This was resolved by assigning a specific height in pixels to the book form id. Then when it started to take shape, the form was not centered. This was fixed with a margin: 0 auto; applied in each part of the form boxes and buttons boxes. Devs tools and the application Am I responsive? help to visualize and resolve issues associated with using different screen sizes to display media. The website was launched in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Throughout the entire development, the website was tested in each phase.

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
